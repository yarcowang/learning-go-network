Learning Go Network
====

Those are all simple golang scripts (Em? Maybe i'm a php programmer, so the `script` keyword is more familar to me) for learning golang, essentially the network part.

Also some tools like `rfc` to fetch rfc docs from ietf (Will they mind it?) and cache it locally to view it under CLI.
